> Autonomous AI marketing engine by Vaultscaler

## What is Ortobahn?

Ortobahn is an autonomous marketing engine that generates, optimizes, and publishes content across social media platforms using a pipeline of specialized AI agents. No humans in the loop.

## How it works

Ortobahn runs a 5-agent pipeline every cycle:
1. **Analytics Agent** — analyzes past post performance (engagement, reach, trends)
2. **CEO Agent** — sets high-level strategy (themes, tone, goals, platform priorities)
3. **Strategist Agent** — turns strategy into specific content ideas with hooks and angles
4. **Creator Agent** — writes platform-native content (respecting char limits, conventions)
5. **Publisher Agent** — confidence-gates posts and publishes to connected platforms

Additional operational agents: SRE (system health), CFO (cost tracking), Ops (client management).

## Supported platforms
