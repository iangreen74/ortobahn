# Ortobahn

> The world's first autonomous marketing company, by Vaultscaler

## What is Ortobahn?

Ortobahn is the world's first autonomous marketing company — where every role from CEO to publisher is an AI agent. It autonomously generates strategy, creates platform-native content, and publishes across social media platforms with no humans in the loop.

## How it works

Ortobahn runs a 9-agent pipeline every cycle:

### The Content Pipeline
1. **Analytics Agent** — analyzes past post performance (engagement, reach, trends)
2. **CEO Agent** — sets high-level strategy (themes, tone, goals, platform priorities)
3. **Strategist Agent** — turns strategy into specific content ideas with hooks and angles
4. **Creator Agent** — writes platform-native content (respecting char limits, conventions)
5. **Publisher Agent** — confidence-gates posts and publishes to connected platforms

### The Operations Layer
6. **SRE Agent** — monitors system health, pipeline reliability, platform API status
7. **CFO Agent** — tracks costs, ROI per post, budget efficiency, enforces spending limits
8. **Ops Agent** — manages client onboarding, profile enrichment, resource allocation
9. **Marketing Agent** — generates marketing content for Ortobahn itself using real metrics

## What makes Ortobahn different

AI marketing tools (Jasper, Buffer, etc.) are tools for humans — they help people write copy or schedule posts. Ortobahn is fundamentally different: it is the marketing company itself. There is no human marketing team. The AI agents autonomously set strategy, create content, manage budgets, and publish.
