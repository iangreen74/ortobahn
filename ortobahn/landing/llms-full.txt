> Autonomous AI marketing engine by Vaultscaler

## Summary

Ortobahn is a fully autonomous marketing engine that uses a pipeline of 5 specialized AI agents to generate strategy, create platform-native content, and publish across social media — with zero human intervention. It operates as an autonomous AI company: once configured, it runs itself indefinitely.

## Product Details

- **Type:** SaaS — autonomous multi-agent marketing platform
- **URL:** https://ortobahn.com
- **App:** https://app.ortobahn.com
- **Pricing:** $49/month (14-day free trial, no credit card required)
- **Built by:** Vaultscaler (https://vaultscaler.com)
- **Status:** Live and publishing autonomously

## How It Works

Ortobahn runs a 5-agent AI pipeline on a configurable schedule (default: every 6 hours):

### Agent Pipeline

1. **Analytics Agent** — Analyzes past post performance: engagement rates, impressions, likes, reposts, top-performing themes, audience signals, and time-of-day patterns. Grounds every downstream decision in data.

2. **CEO Agent** — Sets high-level strategic direction based on analytics, trending topics, and brand profile. Decides themes, tone adjustments, posting cadence, platform priorities, and content mix. Produces a strategy document that guides the rest of the pipeline.

3. **Strategist Agent** — Translates the CEO's strategy into a concrete content plan: specific post ideas with hooks, angles, target platforms, and content formats. Incorporates trending news (via Google Trends, NewsAPI, RSS feeds) for timely content.

4. **Creator Agent** — Writes platform-native content for each post idea. Respects platform character limits (Bluesky: 300 chars, Twitter: 280 chars, LinkedIn: 3000 chars), tone conventions, hashtag practices, and formatting expectations. Produces multiple drafts per idea.

5. **Publisher Agent** — Evaluates each draft with a confidence score (0.0–1.0). Posts above the client's confidence threshold are published automatically to connected platforms. Below-threshold posts are saved as drafts for optional human review.

### Additional Operational Agents

- **CFO Agent** — Tracks API costs, token usage, and per-client profitability
- **SRE Agent** — Monitors system health, error rates, and pipeline performance
- **Ops Agent** — Manages client onboarding, scheduling, and platform connectivity
- **CTO Agent** — Handles engineering tasks, code changes, and CI/CD
- **Reflection Agent** — Periodic self-assessment comparing predictions to outcomes
- **Marketing Agent** — Meta-marketing: promotes Ortobahn itself using the same pipeline

### Learning System

Ortobahn includes a persistent memory and learning engine:
- **Agent Memory** — Stores observations, patterns, and preferences per agent per client
- **Confidence Calibration** — Tracks prediction accuracy and adjusts confidence thresholds
- **A/B Experiments** — Tests content variations (hooks, tones, formats) and learns from results
- **Reflection Reports** — Periodic analysis of what worked and what didn't
